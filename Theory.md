The theory of collective phenomena in animals, herds, and schools is fundamentally rooted in self-organization, a process where complex, ordered, and adaptive behaviors emerge from the simple, local interactions of individual animals, rather than from centralized control. 
The primary framework for understanding this is Self-Propelled Particle (SPP) models, which simulate how animals behave based on simple rules regarding their immediate neighbors. 

Core Principles of Collective Behavior
According to the theory of self-organization, animal groups operate based on three main, repeated interactions:
Alignment: Adopting the same direction as nearby neighbors.
Attraction: Moving towards neighbors to avoid becoming isolated.
Repulsion: Moving away from very nearby neighbors to avoid collisions. 
These simple, local rules generate large-scale, cohesive, and ordered structures—such as schools, flocks, or herds—that allow the group to function efficiently. 

Key Theoretical Models
The Vicsek Model (Self-Propelled Particles): Proposes that individual particles (animals) move with constant speed and align their direction with the average direction of neighbors within a specific radius, producing a transition from disordered to ordered motion.
The "Three-Zone" Model (Couzin et al.): Defines three specific zones around an individual—repulsion, alignment, and attraction—which determine how the individual reacts to others. Adjusting the size of these zones can change a group from a static swarm to a rotating "torus" or a parallel marching group.
Topological vs. Metric Interaction: Recent studies suggest that, rather than interacting with all neighbors within a fixed distance (metric), birds and fish often interact with a fixed number of neighbors (roughly 6 or 7) regardless of how far away they are (topological).
Selfish Herd Theory: Proposed by Hamilton, this theory suggests that individuals in a group aggregate to reduce their own risk of being caught by a predator (by placing others between themselves and the threat), creating a dense group to minimize their "domain of danger". 

Key Mechanisms Driving Collective Behavior
Positive Feedback: A small initial action (e.g., an ant finding food) is amplified, causing the group to rapidly adopt the action, such as in pheromone trail formation.
Negative Feedback: Mechanisms that stabilize behavior and stop it from going to extremes, such as when ants stop laying pheromone after a food source is exhausted.
Quorum Thresholds: Many animals, particularly social insects and fish, only switch behaviors (e.g., leaving a nest, moving to a new food source) once a minimum number of other individuals (a "quorum") have already done so.
Shared Information (Memory): In some groups, like pigeons, collective movement is a weighted mix of individual preferences and the preferences of their neighbors. 

Proposed Functions of Collective Behavior
Collective behavior has evolved because it offers several benefits:
Anti-predator protection: Including the "many eyes" hypothesis (higher vigilance) and the "predator confusion effect" (hard to single out individuals).
Enhanced Foraging: Groups can locate resources faster and share information about food quality.
Locomotion Efficiency: Animals save energy by moving in specific formations (e.g., V-shaped flocking, drafting). 
These collective behaviors are often described as being "more than the sum of their parts," where the group achieves a level of performance or efficiency that no individual could achieve alone.
