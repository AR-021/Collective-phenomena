# Collective-phenomena
Understanding how simple interaction rules can produce complex, emergent motion. Inspired by the Couzin metric model, I coded a full MATLAB simulation that reproduces polarisation, clustering and milling. Along the way I compared metric vs topological neighbourhood concepts, explored Artificial Swarm Intelligence.
